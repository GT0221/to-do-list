# to-do-list

This is a to do list project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Users can create new unique projects and add task to those projects.
Task are sorted by due date (earliest). You can delete tasks or marked
them as completed. Priority of the task is marked by the left border color
of the task container itself, with green being lowest priotity, yellow somewhat
important and red very important.

Let's say that I am rebuilding a car. My first step would be
to create a new project called "Rebuild the car". Next step, in the
newly create project page click "+ New Task", Fill out information for
the task and click submit. The new task will now be displayed in the "Rebuild
the car".
